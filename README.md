# WÃ½cuc - Wikipedia API Project

This REST API enables fetching information from Wikipedia based on search terms and specified language.  
It allows searching for articles with a given term and returns the first paragraph of the article in the requested language, a list of articles containing the term if the exact article is not found, or a 404 response if no relevant articles exist.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Step 1: Setting Up Virtual Environment

Before you start, make sure you have Python 3.11 installed. Then, create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2: Installing Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

To run the server on your local machine, navigate to project folder and execute:
